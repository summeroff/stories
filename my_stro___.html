      My name is <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">Joseph ███████</span>, though the name on my first baseball mitt was
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">not that one</span>. I am writing this at a safehouse in
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">[geography omitted by doctor’s orders]</span>, coffee cooling to the temperature of
      poor decisions. What follows is the truest account I can give, filtered through a condition the Agency physicians
      call <em>preemptive redaction syndrome</em> - a neurological tick that slaps blackout ink across words my hands suspect
      might cause trouble. Imagine a conscience with a marker.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      I was born on a Tuesday that smelled like hot asphalt and oranges. Mother kind, ferocious, a librarian who moved
      like a quiet alarm, taught me that everything important had a call number and a place to return to. Father was a
      mechanic and a poet until the phone rang too late one night from <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">the county line</span>.
      We drove out in silence, the road shouldering us toward a set of headlights parked wrong, the world rearranged by
      a driver who had been drinking <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">cheap courage</span>. That was my first lesson in
      classification: there are facts you can hold in daylight and facts that hiss when you touch them.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      In college I studied languages because secrets wear accents. I learned to order coffee in
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">two</span> dialects and apologize in
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">five</span>. My thesis tracked rumor propagation through transit stations; it read like
      a love letter to eavesdropping. A visiting lecturer with the posture of a chess piece invited me to a job fair in
      a hotel ballroom that wasn’t on the hotel’s website. The booth had no logo, only a bowl of peppermints and an
      application with a question that made my fingers stall: “Describe a time you disappeared.” I wrote,
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">I practice once a day</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      Training was months of unlearning: how to see a room as a topology problem; how to make my pulse insist on the
      correct story; how to smile with the same number of teeth in <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">every country</span>.
      They taught us to treat our own histories like staged apartments, move the furniture often, leave dishes drying so
      the place looks lived in, hide the real valuables in ugly boxes. On the last day, an instructor slid a file across
      the table, my alias, my new line of credit, my allergies (invented), my sister (removed). There was a black bar over
      the name of the handler I would meet in <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">the capital</span>. I remember thinking:
      how considerate, to shield me from what I most needed to know.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      First posting: a consulate with carpets that smelled like old decisions and polite despair. The man I met there
      answered to <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">“Mr. L.”</span> and everyone pretended not to notice the
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">burn scar</span> on his wrist shaped like a map of a small country that no longer exists.
      My tasks were minor variations on curiosity, listen here, misfile there, let the right people underestimate you.
      I wrote reports so neutral they could have been used to season food. Then came the first time the syndrome
      interfered. The cable read:
      “SUBJECT: <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">████████</span> CONTACTED AT <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">██████</span>;
      DELIVERED PACKAGE <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">███████████</span>.” I swear I typed the details; the bars arrived
      like thunderheads, my own motor cortex laying down cloud cover. Mr. L. circled the black squares and said,
      “Kid, you’re either a liability or a prophet.”
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      Assignments multiplied. There was a courier run through a market that sold seven kinds of honey and exactly one
      truth. There was a room over a bakery where my window framed the morning like a surveillance feed. There was a
      woman who sold <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">newspapers</span> and knew everything a city gossiped into the rain
      gutters. I asked her once why people told her so much. “Because I hand them change,” she said. “Everyone trusts a
      hand that gives something back.” I haven’t forgotten that. When I proposed to her, yes, that happened, and yes, I
      meant it, my syndrome struck with comic timing and tragedy’s handwriting. The note read:
      “Will you <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">██████</span> me?” She laughed, then didn’t. I never sent the note.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      Fieldwork teaches you that certainty is a costume. On an operation in
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">[city withheld]</span>, I watched a man memorize a phone number by humming it. On
      another, I carried a shopping bag heavy with what looked like produce and wasn’t. The photo from that day shows me
      mid-stride, expression set to "tourist,” passing a wall graffiti’d with a joke about patriotism that I still don’t
      understand. The after-action memo would have cleared three names if not for my blackout reflex: the source
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">who risked everything</span>, the officer
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">who missed a signal</span>, and the target
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">who didn’t look back</span>. Sometimes the bars spare the innocent; sometimes
      they spare me.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      The doctors hooked my skull to a forest of sensors. “Your amygdala is over-zealous,” one said, as if my fear
      center were an overachieving intern. They tried therapy, mindfulness, a diet that replaced caffeine with
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">warm disappointment</span>. Nothing stopped the self-censor. Eventually a
      different doctor shrugged in the universal dialect of pragmatists and wrote a note for my personnel file:
      “Operative displays <em>anticipatory classification</em>. Side effect: auto-redaction. Operational utility:
      uncertain. Moral utility: intriguing.”
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      Here is what I can say without the bars jumping like fish: I believe in the geometry of small kindnesses. I carry
      a pocket notebook with a list titled PEOPLE I OWE CALLS and another titled THINGS TO FORGIVE. I have failed both
      lists more than once. I no longer pretend that the work subdivides neatly into right and wrong; mostly it’s right
      now and wrong later, with paperwork. I have a key on my ring that opens a door in
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">a city I miss</span>. I have a scar that looks like a misplaced comma.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      This condition, this blackout pen in my bones, is not mercy and not betrayal. It is a reminder that truth has
      gradients. The Agency once taught me that secrets save lives; I have learned that sometimes they save
      <em>selves</em>, the softer, stupider parts that still want to try again tomorrow. If these pages frustrate you,
      imagine living them. Imagine loving someone in declarative sentences when your verbs turn into
      <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">███████</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="section">
      I don’t know how this ends. Maybe with a desk, a garden, and the kind of peace that doesn’t feel like a
      surveillance state in miniature. Maybe with a bell on a door that rings when she walks in, and I finally say the
      thing the bars keep swallowing. If so, let the record show I tried to write it here, in black and white, before my
      nervous system filed it under <span class="redact" aria-label="[REDACTED]">need-to-know</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="section note">
      Note to future reviewers: If you are reading this in the wake of something loud, know that most days were quiet.
      The work, like the heart, specializes in maintenance. On those days my syndrome redacted only the little luxuries:
      the name of a café, the punchline of a joke, the street where a stray dog decided I was worth escorting home.
      Perhaps that is the correct scale for secrecy. Perhaps the big things are meant to be said aloud, and the small
      things protected by a simple, stubborn bar of ink.
